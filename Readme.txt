Hi this is my submission for the test organised via Indeed

This game has been made to run on android 

The design guidelines given in the google doc were followed 

I have also added my own touches like a health bar to make the game more engaging

The collectable Orbs are green and restore the player's health completing the loop


start -> tap to jump -> avoid obstacles -> die of low health -> start again
